    "This Notebook performs a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers (a kaggle competition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a continuous value (a number), this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).\n",

    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem here is that we have to predict the sale price of Bulldozers!\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have to create a machine learning model that can predict the sale price of Bulldozers given different characteristics of bulldozers sold in the Past!\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, we have a regression problem to predict a continuous value (price).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Available\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data), we can say it's a Time Series problem, we have a time attribute in our dataset. Including features like size, manufacture date, model type etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main datasets:\n",
    "1. **Train.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including `SalePrice` which is the **target variable**).\n",
    "2. **Valid.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as **Train.csv**).\n",
    "3. **Test.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the `SalePrice` attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, [Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being root mean squared log error (RMSLE)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation). As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how well our model is doing, we'll calculate the RMSLE and then compare our results to others on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are different parts of the data that will help us to predict the target (price in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've to find and explore our data set, to fully understand what each feature means!\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common ways to do this, is to create a **data dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, [Kaggle provide a data dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) which contains information about what each attribute of the dataset means!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see it here! (Can refer [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Im3Yq6ez5Yzz7lTfW66PThq1Se__a4P2r1apFkj2asc/edit?usp=sharing) also)"
